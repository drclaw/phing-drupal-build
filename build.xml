<!-- **Phing Drupal Template** is a XML build file for the
**[Phing build system](http://www.phing.info/trac/)** with targets and
configuration designed for **[Drupal](http://drupal.org)** projects.

The aim of the project is to provide a build file which can be used with a
contiuous integration server to ensure clean code - check for compilation
errors, run unit tests, lint code and verify that code standards are upheld.

The template has been developed with the
[Jenkins job template for Drupal projects](http://reload.github.com/jenkins-drupal-template)
and the [Drupal Jenkins demo](http://github.com/kasperg/drupal-jenkins-demo).
It may work with other continuous integration systems.

### Usage

The template can be used in several ways:

* As a starting point for your own build files. Download
[`build.xml`](https://raw.github.com/reload/phing-drupal-template/master/build.xml)
to the root directory of your Drupal project and modify it as needed.

* As the actual build file for your project. You can configure most aspects of
the build according to your project through a properties file. This works
whether you have your entire Drupal project in VCS or use
[drush_make](http://drupal.org/project/drush_make). Download the entire
project and place it in a subfolder or use it as a
[git submodule](http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html).
Using the `build` subfolder from the root directory is recommended. Copy the
`build.default.properties` file to the root directory, rename it
`build.properties` and modify it according to your project. Leave out
properties where you want to use the default values.

### Requirements

Using the template requires a range of PEAR packages present. They can be
installed as follows:

    pear channel-discover pear.phing.info
    pear channel-discover pear.pdepend.org
    pear channel-discover pear.phpmd.org
    pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
    pear channel-discover components.ez.no
    pear channel-discover pear.symfony-project.com

    pear install phing/phing
    pear install  -a phpmd/PHP_PMD
    pear install phpunit/phpcpd
    pear install phpunit/phploc
    pear install PHPDocumentor
    pear install PHP_CodeSniffer
    pear install HTTP_Request2
    pear install -a phpunit/PHP_CodeBrowser

The following must be available from the command line:

* [Drush](http://drupal.org/project/drush): The Drupal shell.
[Installation instructions](http://drupalcode.org/project/drush.git/blob/HEAD:/README.txt).
* PHP 5.2.7 or newer with sqlite extension
* Java Runtime Environment

### Credits

The build file is heavily inspired by Sebastian Bergmans wonderful [template
for Jenkins Jobs for PHP Projects](http://jenkins-php.org/) and began as a
Phing port of his suggested Apache Ant build file.

Many of the same tools are used: [phploc](http://sebastianbergmann.github.com/phploc/),
[phpcpd](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd),
[PHPMD](http://phpmd.org/), [phpDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org/) and [PHP_CodeBrowser](https://github.com/Mayflower/PHP_CodeBrowser).

A couple of additional external tools are downloaded and used during the
build process:

* [Phing Drush Task](http://drupal.org/project/phingdrushtask):
  A custom task for running drush from Phing
* [Phing PHPLoc](https://github.com/raphaelstolt/phploc-phing): A custom task
  for running phploc from Phing
* [jslint4java](http://jslint4java.googlecode.com/): Supports execution of
  jslint from the command line
* [jslintÂ´](https://github.com/mikewest/JSLint): A more humane version of
  Douglas Crockfords JSLint.
* [csslint](http://csslint.net): A tool to help point out problems with CSS code.
* [Mozilla Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/download.html): An implementation of Javascript in Java.
* [Coder](http://drupal.org/project/coder): Drupal module for
  performing code reviews.
