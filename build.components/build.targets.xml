  <!-- ## Main targets
    These are the main targets that will build the project.
    Include this file in your build.xml file for an easy build or, copy
    and paste the code and customize as needed.
  -->

  <!-- ### Build project

  Do a complete build of the project by verifying code consistency and and
  performing static analysis of the code.

  This is the default build target.

  Do not run `docs` for now. Generating documentation eats up memory and build
  time and is largely obsolete when using GitHub. -->

                                analyze" />

  <!-- ### Verify code consistency

  Make sure that our code is clean and functional. -->

  Perform static analysis of the code to generate statistics, identify potential
  problems and opportunities for refactorings and make sure that the code
  complies with coding standards. -->
